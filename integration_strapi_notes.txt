# Strapi Integration Review Notes

## 1. API Endpoints Consistency
- All service files use endpoints like `/bookings`, `/users`, `/services`, etc.
- Double-check that these match your Strapi collection names and routes. Adjust if Strapi uses different names (e.g., `/api/bookings`, `/api/users`).

## 2. Authentication
- Login/register endpoints use `/users/login` and `/users/register`. Strapi's default is `/auth/local` and `/auth/local/register`.
- Update service files if your Strapi uses the default endpoints.
- JWT token handling is centralized via `jwtConfig`.

## 3. Data Mapping
- Strapi responses are usually wrapped in a `data` property (e.g., `{ data: [...] }`).
- Service files currently use `response.data`. If you get nested data, update to `response.data.data`.

## 4. File Uploads
- `contentService.ts` uses FormData for uploads, which matches Strapi's requirements.
- Ensure the endpoint matches your Strapi media upload route (usually `/upload`).

## 5. Permissions
- Set up Strapi roles/permissions for all required endpoints in the Strapi admin panel.

## 6. Code Cleanup
- All mock data and localStorage logic has been removed.
- No unused imports remain in service files.

## 7. Testing
- Test all major flows (bookings, users, reviews, content, vehicles, inventory) with your Strapi backend.

## Next Steps
- Adjust endpoints and data mapping in service files if your Strapi API structure is different.
- Test authentication and file upload flows.
- Confirm permissions in Strapi admin.
- Test the app end-to-end.
