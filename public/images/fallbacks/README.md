# Fallback Images

This directory contains fallback images used when primary images fail to load.

Required fallback images:
- `hero-fallback.jpg` - For hero section images
- `gallery-fallback.jpg` - For gallery images
- `blog-fallback.jpg` - For blog post images  
- `avatar-fallback.jpg` - For user avatar images
- `general-fallback.jpg` - For general purpose images

These images should be:
- Optimized for web (compressed)
- Appropriate dimensions (recommended: 800x600 for general fallbacks)
- Professional looking placeholders
- Small file size for fast loading

You can replace these with actual placeholder images or generate them using tools like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://via.placeholder.com/
- Custom designed placeholders matching your brand
